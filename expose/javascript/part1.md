1. What is printed by line 9?
    The code within the if block will execute because add is true in the call sumValues(10, 10, true). Inside this block, the result variable is initialized to 0 and then reassigned to 20 (the sum of num1 and num2). The console.log statement on line 9 will print: values added: 20
    
    There is no error on this line, and it behaves as expected because result is accessible throughout the entire function.

2. What is printed by line 13? 
    Even though console.log('final result: ', result); is outside the if block, it is still within the same function. Given that var scopes result to the entire function, result is accessible at line 13 as well. Therefore, it will print: final result: 20

    There will be no error from this line because the var declaration of result allows it to be accessed anywhere within the function sumValues, including after the if block.

3. What is printed by line 9?
    Since the if block is executed (add is true), result is initialized to 0 and then set to the sum of num1 and num2, which are both 10. Therefore, result becomes 20.
    The console.log on line 9 will correctly print: values added: 20

    There will be no error from this line because result is accessed within its scope.

4. What is printed by line 13? 
    Line 13 attempts to access result outside of its defining block (if block). Due to the let keyword's block scope, result is not accessible outside the if block where it was declared.
    
    This may result in a ReferenceError because result is not defined in the scope where line 13 tries to access it.

5. What is printed by line 9?
    The code attempts to reassign the result variable after its declaration and initial assignment to 0. This action violates the properties of const, which does not allow reassignment. Therefore, line result = num1 + num2 will throw a TypeError because result is a constant and cannot be changed after its initialization. 
    
    As a result, the console.log on line 9 will never execute because the code will stop executing at the error on line 7.

6. What is printed by line 13? 
    Assuming the error on line 7 did not occur, line 13 would still encounter the same issue with the scope as described with let: result is block-scoped to the if block, so it is not accessible outside of that block.

    Attempting to access result on line 13 would result in a ReferenceError, however, the primary issue is that the code will fail earlier on line 7 due to attempting to reassign a const-declared variable.
